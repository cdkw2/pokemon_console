#Pokemon Battle Simulator
##Introduction
This is a Pokemon battle simulator where the player is given a random Pokemon and has to battle a random Pokemon.

##Getting Started
To get started, the player needs to run the script and follow the prompts. The script will randomly assign the player a Pokemon and a randomly generated opponent Pokemon.

##Gameplay
The game is turn-based. Each turn, the player chooses an action from a list of options, such as attack, use an item, or switch Pokemon. The opponent will also choose an action. The turn then plays out, with each Pokemon using their chosen move. The battle continues until one Pokemon's HP is reduced to zero, at which point the other Pokemon is declared the winner.

##Code Overview
The code is written in Python and consists of several functions, including random_pokemon() to generate a random Pokemon, attack() to calculate damage done by an attack, and game_loop() to run the main game loop.

The script also includes a list of Pokemon and their stats, as well as a list of attacks and their properties.

Overall, the code is designed to simulate a basic Pokemon battle, with randomized Pokemon and turn-based gameplay.
 ##Quick note
 The game was made in 25 minutes as a challenge. (If that sounds bad to you, then try making something lke this yourself under 25 minutes) So there are lot of things that could be improved, like adding actual type advantages, giving choice of attacks and switchin's etc. I may or mayn't update this or maybe I will just make a new project from scratch.
